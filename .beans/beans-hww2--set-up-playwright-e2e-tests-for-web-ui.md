Add Playwright e2e tests with page objects to verify the web UI works correctly, including real-time sorting updates from filesystem changes.

## Summary of Changes

- Added @playwright/test and created playwright.config.ts
- Created page objects: BacklogPage (backlog list view) and BoardPage (kanban board view)
- Created test fixtures with BeansCLI helper for CLI-driven test data setup
- Added e2e/run.sh wrapper script for temp dir lifecycle management
- 5 backlog tests: sorting, re-sort on priority/status change, new bean insertion, deletion
- 4 board tests: column placement, priority sorting, status change moves column, priority re-sort
- Added data-status attribute to BoardView columns for reliable test selectors
- Added mise test:e2e task and pnpm test:e2e script
- Also fixed frontend sorting: added sortBeans() to beans.svelte.ts matching backend sort logic
