title: Suppress noisy logging for benign Claude API stream events

parseInnerEvent only handles content_block_delta and content_block_start. Other benign lifecycle events (content_block_stop, message_delta, message_stop, message_start) fall through to eventUnknown and get logged as 'unhandled event', spamming the logs.

## Summary of Changes

- Added `eventIgnored` event type for recognized-but-not-actionable streaming events
- Handle `content_block_stop`, `message_start`, `message_delta`, `message_stop` inner events as ignored
- Handle top-level `user` events (tool results) as ignored
- Fixed pre-existing `NewManager` call in manager_test.go
- Added test cases for all newly handled event types
