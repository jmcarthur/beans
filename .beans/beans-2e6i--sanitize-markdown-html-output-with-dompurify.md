Both BeanDetail.svelte (line 256) and AgentChat.svelte (line 122) render user/agent-supplied markdown via {@html} after processing through Marked. Marked's GFM mode allows raw HTML in markdown input, so a malicious bean body like `<img onerror=alert(1)>` executes JavaScript. Fix: install DOMPurify, sanitize the HTML string returned by renderMarkdown() before passing it to {@html}. This is the highest-impact fix because XSS is exploitable even on localhost if someone opens a bean with a crafted body. Also audit markdown.ts line 145 where bean IDs are interpolated into HTML attributes — ensure the beanId value is escaped to prevent attribute breakout.
